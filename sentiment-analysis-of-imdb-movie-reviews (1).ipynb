As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.\""},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text1 = 'Check my notebook https://www.kaggle.com/code/mabubakrarshad/sentiment-analysis-of-imdb-movie-reviews/edit'\ntext2 = 'check this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11331982/how-to-remove-any-url-within-a-string-in-python'\ntext3 = 'this is geek for geek link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-urls-from-string-in-python/ and also https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-urls-from-string-in-python/'\ntext4 = 'this is my linkedln www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T19:52:25.619846Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T19:52:25.620267Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T19:52:25.625115Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T19:52:25.620205Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T19:52:25.624034Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def remove_url(text):\n    pattern = re.compile(r'https?://\\S+|www\\.\\S+')\n    return pattern.sub(r'',text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.568888Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.569259Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.573587Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.569188Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.572625Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"remove_url(text4)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.969022Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.969411Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.976347Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.969347Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T19:52:26.975340Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"execution_count":12,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'this is my linkedln '"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"removing punctuation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import string,time","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T19:52:28.195401Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T19:52:28.195730Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T19:52:28.200318Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T19:52:28.195687Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T19:52:28.199137Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"string.punctuation","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.219221Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.219593Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.225947Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.219530Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.225001Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'!\"#$%&\\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"exclude = string.punctuation","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.646020Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.646398Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.651098Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.646335Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T19:52:29.650017Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def remove_punc(text):\n    for char in exclude:\n        text = text.replace(char,'')\n    return text","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T19:52:30.507045Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T19:52:30.507443Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T19:52:30.513089Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T19:52:30.507377Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T19:52:30.511943Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text  = 'Hello!
